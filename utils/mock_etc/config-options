# In production we puppetize nsid_ascii to the (unqualified) hostname of the
# authdns server, and technically in edge cases the length of the hostname here
# could affect whether very large records are accepted or rejected by gdnsd at
# checkconf/start time (e.g. a TXT RR-set with close to 16KB of data).  To
# avoid edge cases passing CI and then failing on the real hosts, we define a
# 64-byte arbitrary nsid_ascii value here so that CI will always fail before
# real hosts do (the longest possible unqualified legal hostname is 63 bytes).
