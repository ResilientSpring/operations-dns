The authdns_gen_zones.py file here is used by our production "authdns-update"
and related infrastructure to generate the final, deployed zonefiles.

There are also two tests here which must be executed from the repo root:

1) zones_validator.py

This validates zone data according to some WMF-specific policy rules, and
requires Python 3.5+.

2) check-gdnsd.sh

This validates that the configuration and zone data load with gdnsd itself.
It uses the same authdns-gen-zones.py that production deployment uses, but
targeted at a temporary directory, and fleshes out the parts of the config
that would normally be supplied by puppet using data from the mock_etc/
subdirectory.  It requires an installed copy of the gdnsd package, as well as
Python and the jinja2 module for the execution of authdns-gen-zones.py.
