The authdns_gen_zones.py file here is used by our production "authdns-update"
and related infrastructure to generate the final, deployed zonefiles.

There are also some tests here which must be executed from the repo root, all
of which should return non-zero if they're failing:

1) utils/zones_validator.py

This validates zone data according to some WMF-specific policy rules, and
requires Python 3.5+ (which implies stretch, here!).  Add the argument "-e" to
actually display any errors found.

2) utils/check-tabs.sh

Checks for tabs in any files in the repo, which we don't allow by policy.
Just a shell script wrapper around "git grep".

3) utils/check-gdnsd.sh

This validates that the configuration and zone data load with gdnsd itself.
It uses the same authdns-gen-zones.py that production deployment uses, but
targeted at a temporary directory, and fleshes out the parts of the config
that would normally be supplied by puppet using data from the mock_etc/
subdirectory.  It requires an installed copy of the gdnsd package, as well as
Python 2 and the jinja2 module for the execution of authdns-gen-zones.py.

4) utils/run-tests.sh

Runs all of the above (even if one fails, all will be run), then pulls their
exit statuses together into a final ERROR/OK output line and final exit
status.  Assumes by default it is run from the repo root, but can also take
the pathname of the repo root as its only argument.
